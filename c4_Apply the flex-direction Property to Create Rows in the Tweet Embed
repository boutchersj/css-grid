grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr

//auto makes the column the size of its content//
//px is an absolute measure//
//% makes the column a percentage of its container size//
//fr divides the available remaining space into sections and cuts it like slices of a pie, so 4th column gets 2 slices and 5th gets 1//

grid-template-columns: 1fr 100px 2fr;

//1 slice of the 3 fr slices goes to the 1st column//
//2nd column gets 100 pixels//
//3rd column gets the other 2 fr slices//
